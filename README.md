Camera Preparation
1.	Click Start Camera.
o	On first use, your browser will ask for camera permissions. Allow access.
o	The rear camera is automatically selected (environment-facing).
2.	Ensure your document is well-lit and positioned fully within the camera frame.
3.	Use a flat surface and hold the device steady to reduce blur.
3. Setting Scan Options (Step 4 & 5)
Before capturing pages, configure the options:
Option	Purpose
Page Format	Select A3, A4, or Letter depending on document size.
DPI	Low (150) → faster, smaller file; Medium (300) → standard; High (400) → maximum quality.
Image Quality	Adjust JPEG compression (0.5 → 1.0). Lower values reduce PDF size.
Tip: For very large documents (100+ pages), use Medium DPI and 0.7–0.85 image quality for balance between clarity and file size.
4. Capturing Pages
1.	Align the document and click Capture Page.
o	Only one page is kept in memory at a time to prevent crashes.
o	After each capture, the page is normalized and automatically added to the PDF.
o	Status messages appear briefly: "Page X captured and added to PDF"
2.	Repeat for all pages in your document.
o	You can capture 100+ pages safely.
o	Keep the camera steady and ensure proper lighting for each page.
5. Downloading the PDF
1.	Once all pages are captured, click Download PDF.
o	The assembled PDF will be saved as JUO_Legacy_Scanner.pdf.
o	File contains all captured pages in order.
2.	After download, the PDF memory is cleared automatically, and you can start a new document.
6. Tips for Large Documents
•	Batch Scanning: If scanning more than 50–100 pages, consider scanning in batches and combining PDFs later to avoid device/browser memory limits.
•	Lighting: Bright, diffuse light reduces shadows and improves clarity.
•	Stability: Use a stand or place your device on a stable surface for consistent page capture.
•	Image Quality: Lowering quality slightly reduces file size significantly without visible loss.
7. Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
Camera does not open	Ensure HTTPS and grant camera permission. Restart browser if needed.
Mobile device shows “permission denied”	Check browser settings → Camera → Allow access for the site.
PDF size too large	Reduce DPI or image quality. Consider scanning in batches.
Pages cropped or misaligned	Use consistent flat surface and center document.
